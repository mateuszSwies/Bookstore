# General info

I created this page as a project to summarize my learning of Bootstrap technology. During its creation, I used various video tutorials and, most importantly, the documentation on the site [getbootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The site introduces an online bookstore. 

You can see different categories of products on the site. Some of them are labeled "BEST" and some "NEW." 


You can also check the 'Contact' tab at the top, to see modal window with contact info.


# Technologies

In this project, I used the following technologies:

- Bootstrap 5.2.2
- jQuery 3.6.1
- popper.js 1.16.1
- webpack 5.74.0
- SASS 1.8.22 
- JavaScript (Vanilla.js)


# Status

I am still working on the development of this project. In the near future, I plan to add 'Best' tab, as well as the ability to move pages in the product view (currently there is one page for each product category).

The next step will be to make a dark mode for the whole site, and finally the ability to create a shopping cart with products.

All the while, this site is meant to be a basis for me to learn more technologies and a place to practice new solutions.


# Source of inspiration

This page is inspired by Jakub Król and Bartłomiej Borowczyk from the course ["Zaawansowane Projekty w CSS i JavaScript"](https://www.udemy.com/course/zaawansowane-projekty-w-css-i-javascript/).
